**Advanced Calculator**

Welcome to my first project that I created in 2019.
Programmed in Python, It fulfils many functions that I found useful in College.

Here’s a basic breakdown of what it does:

- Basic arithmetic equations:
    - Addition of multiple values
    - Subtraction of multiple values
    - Multiplication of multiple values
    - Division of multiple values

- Converting distances:
    - Miles into Kilometres
    - Kilometres into Miles
    - Metres into Yards
    - Yards into Metres
    - Centimetres into Inches
    - Inches into Centimetres

- Converting speeds:
    - km/h into mph
    - mph into km/h
    - m/s into km/h
    - km/h into m/s

- Converting file sizes:
    - Bits into Bytes 
    - Bytes into Bits 
    - Bytes into Kilobytes 
    - Kilobytes into bytes 
    - Kilobytes into bits 
    - Bits into kilobytes 

- Converting Binary to Decimal (or Decimal to Binary)

- Converting Binary to Hexadecimal (or Hexadecimal to Binary)

- Converting Decimal to Hexadecimal (or Hexadecimal to Decimal)

- Password Generations

The program runs on the python terminal  and doesn’t require any extra packages to be installed. 

Known bugs:
- Typos

Quirks (Will be addressed whenever I have time)
- Doesn’t always clear the display
- Some functions return to menu on a time basis but some request the user to press Return/Enter to return to the menu
